## Determine the indefinite article
Please finish the following tasks.
1. Please construct a list `aeiou` that contains all vowels.
2. Given a word `word`, we would like to find the indefinite article `article` before `word`. (Hint: the article should be `an` if the first character of `word` is a vowel, and `a` if not.)

Consider `in`, `.lower()` and `if` structure.

## Datetime and files names
We would like to write a program to quickly generate `N` files. Every time we run the code, `N` files will be generated. We hope to store all files generated and organize them in a neat way. To achieve this, one way is to create a subfolder for each run and store all files generated during that run in the particular subfolder. Since we would like to make it fast, the real point of this task is to find a way to automatically generate the file names for the files generated and the folder names for the subfolders generated. You don't need to worry about the contents of the files and empty files are totally fine for this problem.

::: {.solution}
One way to automatically generate file names and folder names is to use the date and the time when the code is run. Please check `datetime` package for getting and formatting date/time, and `os` packages for playing with files and folders.

## Color the Gnomic data
We can use ASCII color codes in the string to change the color of strings, as an example `\033[91m` for red and `\033[94m` for blue. See the following example.
```{python}
#| eval: false
print('\033[91m'+'red'+'\033[92m'+'green'+'\033[94m'+'blue'+'\033[93m'+'yellow')
```
Consider an (incomplete) Gnomic data given below which is represented by a long sequence of `A`, `C`, `T` and `G`. Please color it using ASCII color codes.

```{python}
Gnomicdata = 'TCGATCTCTTGTAGATCTGTTCTCTAAACGAACTTTAAAATCTGTGTGGCTGTCACTCGG'\
             'CTGCATGCTTAGTGCACTCACGCAGTATAATTAATAACTAATTACTGTCGTTGACAGGAC'\
             'ACGAGTAACTCGTCTATCTTCTGCAGGCTGCTTACGGTTTCGTCCGTGTTGCAGCCGATC'\
             'ATCAGCACATCTAGGTTTTGTCCGGGTGTGACCGAAAGGTAAGATGGAGAGCCTTGTCCC'\
             'TGGTTTCAACGAGAAAACACACGTCCAACTCAGTTTGCCTGTTTTACAGGTTCGCGACGT'\
             'GCTCGTACGTGGCTTTGGAGACTCCGTGGAGGAGGTCTTATCAGAGGCACGTCAACATCT'\
             'TAAAGATGGCACTTGTGGCTTAGTAGAAGTTGAAAAAGGCGTTTTGCCTCAACTTGAACA'\
             'GCCCTATGTGTTCATCAAACGTTCGGATGCTCGAACTGCACCTCATGGTCATGTTATGGT'\
             'TGAGCTGGTAGCAGAACTCGAAGGCATTCAGTACGGTCGTAGTGGTGAGACACTTGGTGT'\
             'CCTTGTCCCTCATGTGGGCGAAATACCAGTGGCTTACCGCAAGGTTCTTCTTCGTAAGAA'\
             'CGGTAATAAAGGAGCTGGTGGCCATAGTTACGGCGCCGATCTAAAGTCATTTGACTTAGG'\
             'CGACGAGCTTGGCACTGATCCTTATGAAGATTTTCAAGAAAACTGGAACACTAAACATAG'
```

## Hint
You may use `if` to do the conversion. Or you may use `dict` to do the conversion.
