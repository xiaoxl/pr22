## Comma Code
Say you have a list value like this: `spam = ['apples', 'bananas', 'tofu', 'cats']`. 

Write a function that takes a list value as an argument and returns a string with all the items separated by a comma and a space, with `and` inserted before the last item. For example, passing the previous `spam` list to the function would return 'apples, bananas, tofu, and cats'. But your function should be able to work with any list value passed to it. Be sure to test the case where an empty list `[]` is passed to your function.

## Fantasy Game Inventory
You are creating a fantasy video game. The data structure to model the playerâ€™s inventory will be a dictionary where the keys are string values describing the item in the inventory and the value is an integer value detailing how many of that item the player has. For example, the dictionary value `{'rope': 1, 'torch': 6, 'gold coin': 42, 'dagger': 1, 'arrow': 12}` means the player has 1 rope, 6 torches, 42 gold coins, and so on.

Write a function named `displayInventory()` that would take any possible `inventory` and display it like the following:

```{python}
#| eval: false
Inventory:
12 arrow
42 gold coin
1 rope
6 torch
1 dagger
Total number of items: 62
```

Note that this is the function version of @exr-fantasyinventorycode.
