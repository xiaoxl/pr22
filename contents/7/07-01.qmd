```{r}
print('Hello world!')
```


## Essential concepts

- In R, assignments is ` <- `, not `=`. `=` actually works, but it may cause confusions. So it is always recommended to use ` <- `. The R Studio keybinding for ` <- ` is `alt+-`.
- `.` is NOT a special character in R, and can be used in variable names. So `is.na()` simply means a function called `is.na`. It is not a function `na` in a package `is` as in Python.
