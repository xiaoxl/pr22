# R Fundamentals

@Wic2017

A few advantages about R:

- Free and open source comparing to some other tools like Excel and SPSS.
- Optimized with vectorization.




```{r}
#| label: fig-airquality
#| fig-cap: Temperature and ozone level.
#| warning: false

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess"
)

print(R.version)
```
