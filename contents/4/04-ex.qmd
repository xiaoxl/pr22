## Heron's formula
Consider a triangle whose sides are $a$, $b$ and $c$. Heron's formula states that the area of this triangle is 
$$\sqrt{s(s−a)(s−b)(s−c)}\quad\text{ where } s=\frac12(a+b+c).$$

Please write a function that given three points computes the area of the triangle with vertices being the given points. The input is required to be a `list` of three `tuple`s, where each `tuple` contains two numbers representing the 2d-coordinate of a point.
