This is a Python question. Please download the datasets from here. It is the same datasets as in @exm-tidydatasets. Please use Python to finish the following tasks.

::: {#exr-}
Why are `gather()` and `spread()` not perfectly symmetrical? Carefully consider the following example:


```{r}
stocks <- tibble(
    year = c(2015, 2015, 2016, 2016),
    half = c( 1, 2, 1, 2),
    return = c(1.88, 0.59, 0.92, 0.17)
)
stocks %>%
    spread(year, return) %>%
    gather("year", "return", `2015`:`2016`)
```
(Hint: look at the variable types and think about column `names`.)

Both `spread()` and `gather()` have a `convert` argument. What does it do?

Why does this code fail?
```{r}
#| error: true
table4a %>%
    gather(1999, 2000, key = "year", value = "cases")
```
